# API Doc Token Switcher

A helper extension for the Nelmio API Doc Bundle that allows for developers to switch between user authentication tokens for all API endpoints. It targets the first key / value input fields under the Headers portion of the endpoints, allowing for additional header files to be used if necessary.
